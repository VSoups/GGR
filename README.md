## Next Steps

- **Navigating to other user profiles:** Since users can click on "Profle" in the nav bar to see their own profile, the user should be able to click on the usernernames in other posts to see their reviews and favorite games.

- **Sorting games:** On the games page the user should be able to sort the available games by their tags and favorites.

- **Commenting on Posts:** On user reviews, users should be able to comment on posts made to agree or offer counter points to their opinion.

- **Sort reviews by date:** After an extended period of the website being up, the user should be able to sort reviews by their post date. The User schema already has timestamps, so this could be a quick addition.
